Steps to replicate GraphDB Repository:

- Run GraphDB-Desktop and open port 7200 on web browser

- Create new repository without modifying basic settings

- Import "Export_repo_Group09" (Setting the default graph "target graph" )

The repository is now set up and queries can be executed.

Example queries can be found in "HandsOn/Group09/rdf" in the form of "queries.sparql" and "queries_with-links.sparql"
